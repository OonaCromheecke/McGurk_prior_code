This set of functions correspond to the implementation of the method 
described in "Adaptive thresholding for reliable topological inference in 
single subject fMRI analysis - Front. Hum. Neurosci. 6:245. 
doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00245"

They are programmed to interact with the SPM software 
- you can either call the functions directly or via the SPM pulldown
menu if functons were unzipped into the toolbox folfer
